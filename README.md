Feature Extraction from Product Images Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of extracting key product details, such as weight, dimensions, and volume, directly from images. The solution is designed for applications in e-commerce, healthcare, and content moderation, where accurate product information is crucial.

Key features of this project include:

    A complete pipeline for downloading images, training the model, and generating predictions.
    Model optimization using F1 score, balancing precision and recall.
    Compliance with predefined formatting and unit constraints, ensured through a custom sanity checker.
    Output predictions in standard format using the allowed units for each product entity.

This project automates the extraction of critical product information to solve real-world challenges in digital marketplaces.
