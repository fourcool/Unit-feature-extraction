Feature Extraction from Product Images Using Machine Learning <br />
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of extracting key product details, such as weight, dimensions, and volume, directly from images. The solution is designed for applications in e-commerce, healthcare, and content moderation, where accurate product information is crucial.

Key features of this project include:

1. A complete pipeline for downloading images, training the model, and generating predictions.
2. Model optimization using F1 score, balancing precision and recall.
3. Compliance with predefined formatting and unit constraints, ensured through a custom sanity checker.
4. Output predictions in standard format using the allowed units for each product entity.

This project automates the extraction of critical product information to solve real-world challenges in digital marketplaces.
